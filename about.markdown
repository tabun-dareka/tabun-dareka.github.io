Currently I'm studying computer science in Wroclaw, Poland.
My hobbies are:
- Programming. Mostly low level. I feel confident writing in c and c++ but somewhere in the future I want to checkout Rust.
I also know python pretty well.
- Hacking. In ctf competitions I focus on binary exploitation.
- Watching good animation (anime and cartoons).
- Listening to weird music (Otoboke Beaver, Midori, Melt-Banana etc).
